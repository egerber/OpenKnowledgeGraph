Windows 10 is an operating system developed by Microsoft. Microsoft described Windows 10 as an "operating system as a service" that would receive ongoing updates to its features and functionality, augmented with the ability for enterprise environments to receive non-critical updates at a slower pace, or use long-term support milestones that will only receive critical updates, such as security patches, over their five-year lifespan of mainstream support. Terry Myerson, executive vice president of Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group, said that the goal of this model was to reduce fragmentation across the Windows platform.. Windows 10 Insider Preview builds are delivered to Insiders in three different rings. Insiders in the fast ring receive updates prior to those in the slow ring, but might experience more bugs and other issues. Insiders in the release preview ring do not receive updates until the version is almost available to the public, but are comparatively more stable.. Mainstream builds of Windows 10 are labeled "YYMM", with YY representing the two-digit year and MM representing the month of planned release !Highlights |}
