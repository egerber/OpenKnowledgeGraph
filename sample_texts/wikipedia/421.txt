The 2019 United States elections were held, in large part, on Tuesday, November 5, 2019. This off-year election included gubernatorial elections in Kentucky, Louisiana, and Mississippi, regularly-scheduled state legislative elections in Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia, and New Jersey, and special elections for seats in various state legislatures. Numerous citizen initiatives, mayoral races, and a variety of other local elections also occurred. Three special elections to the United States House of Representatives also took place in 2019 as a result of vacancies. Democrats regained the governorship of Kentucky and held the office in Louisiana, despite strong campaign efforts by President Donald Trump for the Republican candidates. Democrats also took control of the state legislature in Virginia. Republicans held the governor's mansion in Mississippi and expanded their control of the Louisiana state legislature and gained seats in the New Jersey state legislature. A major theme in the election results was a suburban revolt against Trump and the Republican Party in general, as these areas swung heavily towards Democratic candidates in local, state, and federal elections.. Three special elections were held in 2019 to fill vacancies during the 116th U.S. Congress: Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district: Republican Tom Marino resigned on January 23, 2019, to take a private sector job.

North Carolina's 3rd congressional district: Republican Walter B. Jones Jr. died on February 10, 2019. The district has a partisan index of R+12. Republican state Rep. Greg Murphy was elected, defeating Democrat Allen M. Thomas and Libertarian Tim Harris.

Georgia Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson announced in August 2019 that he would resign on December 31, 2019, due to deteriorating health.

Justin Amash declared he would leave the Republican Party but continue to serve in Congress as an independent, affecting the partisan balance of the Michigan delegation.. Three states held gubernatorial elections in 2019: Kentucky: In the May 21 primaries, one-term incumbent Republican Matt Bevin faced a strong challenge from three opponents in the Republican primary but managed to win with 52.4%; Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear also faced a strong competition from two other challengers in the Democratic primary but managed to win with 37.9%. In the November 5 general election, Andy Beshear defeated Matt Bevin by just 0.4 percent of the vote; however, the Associated Press declared the race too close to call, and Bevin refused to concede on election night, requesting a recanvass. The recanvass showed little change in the vote totals, and Bevin conceded the election on November 14. Louisiana: One-term Democrat John Bel Edwards defeated Eddie Rispone in a run-off election, securing a second term. In the state's October blanket primary, Edwards faced Republicans U.S. Rep. Ralph Abraham and businessman Eddie Rispone, along with three minor candidates. While Edwards received 46.6% of the vote, he did not win a majority and therefore faces a Saturday, November 16 runoff election against Rispone, who received 27.4% of the vote. The runoff election was held on November 16th. Despite Republican Donald Trump winning the state by 20 points in 2016, John Bel Edwards was able to narrowly win re-election with 51.3% of the vote against Eddie Rispone's 48.7%. Mississippi: Two-term Republican Phil Bryant was in 2019 and therefore ineligible to seek re-election. In the August 6 primary elections, Attorney General Jim Hood won the Democratic primary, and on August 27, Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves defeated Mississippi Supreme Court Chief Justice Bill Waller Jr. to win the Republican nomination. Though the Associated Press described Hood as the "best-funded Democratic nominee for Mississippi governor since 2003," Reeves won the Mississippi gubernatorial race by a comfortable 52.3% to 46.5% margin. Legislative elections were held for both houses of the Louisiana Legislature, the Mississippi Legislature, and the Virginia General Assembly, as well as the lower house of the New Jersey Legislature. Republicans maintained control of the Mississippi Legislature, while Democrats kept control of the New Jersey Legislature. Democrats gained majorities of both houses of the Virginia General Assembly, giving them control of the legislature for the first time in 20 years. In Louisiana, Republicans expanded their control of the Louisiana Legislature, gaining a supermajority in the state Senate and falling two seats shy of a supermajority in the Louisiana House. Special elections were also held during the year to fill state legislative seats vacated due to retirement, death, resignation, election to another office, or other reasons. , special elections have been set or run for 77 seats â€” 39 held by Democrats and 38 held by Republicans. , of the 72 special elections held, five seats flipped from Democratic to Republican, two flipped from Republican to Democratic, and one flipped from Republican to Independent. None of these changes impacted partisan control of the state legislature. In the 2019 elections, Republicans successfully defended their "trifecta" in Mississippi, while Democrats defended their trifecta in New Jersey and prevented Republicans from gaining a trifecta in Louisiana. Republicans lost their trifecta in Kentucky, while Democrats gained a trifecta in Virginia. These state elections will impact the redistricting that will follow the 2020 United States Census, as many states task governors and state legislators with drawing new boundaries for state legislative and Congressional districts. 24 binding ballot measures were voted on in seven states.In Pennsylvania, voters were to consider a constitutional amendment to adopt Marsy's Law protections for crime victims.
