'UFC 244: Masvidal vs. Diaz' was a mixed martial arts pay-per-view event produced by the Ultimate Fighting Championship that took place on November 2, 2019 at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. The event was also the UFC's 500th live event. President Donald Trump attended the event and was greeted with a mix of cheers and boos. It was the first mixed martial arts event attended by a sitting U.S. president. UFC president Dana White stated that Trump has a long history of support for the UFC.. A welterweight bout between Jorge Masvidal and former UFC Lightweight Championship challenger and The Ultimate Fighter 5 lightweight winner Nate Diaz headlined the event. After his UFC 241 win against former lightweight champion Anthony Pettis, Diaz proclaimed himself the "baddest motherfucker in the game" and issued a challenge to Masvidal. That led up to the booking of this fight and Dana White also confirmed that a celebratory "baddest motherfucker" issued a rare statement that they would be pursuing disciplinary action against The Ultimate Fighter: Team Jones vs. Team Sonnen middleweight winner and former interim title challenger Kelvin Gastelum. Per the statement, the Athletic Commission stated upon review of Gastelum's weigh-in video that they "determined that Mr. Gastelum made contact with another person while on the scale, a violation of the weigh in policy. In light of this violation, the Commission will pursue disciplinary action. At this time, the official weight determination will not be disturbed, and Mr. Gastelum will not be disqualified from competing in UFC 244.". On November 8, it was announced that Corey Anderson was fined $10,000 by the NYSAC for "unsportsmanlike and disorderly conduct" for taunting and screaming at Johnny Walker and shoving the referee away during his post-fight celebration. Also, Kelvin Gastelum was fined $1,000 for making physical contact with his coach Rafael Cordeiro at the weigh-ins.
