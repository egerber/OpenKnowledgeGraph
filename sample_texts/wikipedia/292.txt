ISO 8601 Data elements and interchange formats – Information interchange – Representation of dates and times is an international standard covering the exchange of date- and time-related data. It was issued by the International Organization for Standardization that are given specific meanings within the standard; the implication is that some commonplace ways of writing parts of dates, such as "January" or "Thursday", are not allowed in interchange representations.. The first edition of the ISO&nbsp;8601 standard was published as ISO&nbsp;8601:1988 in 1988. It unified and replaced a number of older ISO standards on various aspects of date and time notation: ISO 2014, ISO 2015, ISO 2711, ISO 3307, and ISO 4031. It has been superseded by a second edition ISO&nbsp;8601:2000 in 2000, by a third edition ISO&nbsp;8601:2004 published on 1 December 2004, and withdrawn and revised by ISO&nbsp;8601-1:2019 and ISO&nbsp;8601-2:2019 on 25 February 25 2019. ISO 8601 was prepared by, and is under the direct responsibility of, ISO Technical Committee TC 154. ISO&nbsp;2014, though superseded, is the standard that originally introduced the all-numeric date notation in most-to-least-significant order . The ISO week numbering system was introduced in ISO&nbsp;2015, and the identification of days by ordinal dates was originally defined in ISO&nbsp;2711. The draft ISO/DIS 8601-1:2016 represents the slightly updated contents of the current ISO 8601 standard, whereas the draft ISO/DIS 8601-2:2016 defines various extensions such as uncertainties or parts of the Extended Date/Time Format .. *Date and time values are ordered from the largest to smallest unit of time: year, month 2004. This format will never represent the 5th day of an unspecified month in 2004, nor will it represent a time-span extending from 2004 into 2005.If necessary for a particular application, the standard supports the addition of a decimal fraction to the smallest time value in the representation.. The standard uses the Gregorian calendar, which serves as an international standard for civil use. ISO 8601 fixes a reference calendar date to the Gregorian calendar of 20 May 1875 as the date the .. ISO 8601 uses the 24-hour clock system. The basic format is . So if the time being described is one hour ahead of UTC, such as the time in Luanda, the zone designator would be "+01:00", "+0100", or simply "+01". To represent a time behind UTC the offset is negative. For example, the time in Quito is UTC−05:00 and the zone designator would then be "&minus;05:00", "&minus;0500", or simply "&minus;05". For other time offsets see List of UTC time offsets. To represent a negative offset, ISO 8601 specifies using either a hyphen&ndash;minus or a minus sign character. If the interchange character set is limited and does not have a minus sign character, then the hyphen&ndash;minus should be used. ASCII does not have a minus sign, so its hyphen&ndash;minus character states that a plus sign must be used for a positive or zero value, and a minus sign for a negative value. Contrary to this rule, RFC 3339, which is otherwise a profile of ISO 8601, permits the use of "-00", with the same denotation as "+00" but a differing connotation.. Durations define the amount of intervening time in a time interval and are represented by the format P. Leading zeros are not required, but the maximum number of digits for each element should be agreed to by the communicating parties. The capital letters P, Y, M, W, D, T, H, M, and S are designators for each of the date and time elements and are not replaced.P is the duration designator is widely used independent of time intervals, as with the Java 8 Duration class.. A time interval is the intervening time between two time points. The amount of intervening time is expressed by a duration , then this is the end of the repeating interval. For example, to repeat the interval of "P1Y2M10DT2H30M" five times starting at , use .. On the Internet, the World Wide Web Consortium uses ISO 8601 in defining a profile of the standard that restricts the supported date and time formats to reduce the chance of error and the complexity of software. ISO 8601 is referenced by several specifications, but the full range of options of ISO 8601 is not always used. For example, the various electronic program guide standards for TV, digital radio, etc. use several forms to describe points in time and durations. The ID3 audio meta-data specification also makes use of a subset of ISO 8601. The X.690 encoding standard's GeneralizedTime makes use of another subset of ISO 8601. The ISO 8601 week date, as of 2006, appeared in its basic form on major brand commercial packaging in the United States. Its appearance depended on the particular packaging, canning, or bottling plant more than any particular brand. The format is particularly useful for quality assurance, so that production errors can be readily traced to work weeks, and products can be correctly targeted for recall. RFC 3339 defines a profile of ISO 8601 for use in Internet protocols and standards. It explicitly excludes durations and dates before the common era. The more complex formats such as week numbers and ordinal days are not permitted. RFC 3339 deviates from ISO 8601 in allowing a zero time zone offset to be specified as "-00:00", which ISO 8601 forbids. RFC 3339 intends "-00:00" to carry the connotation that it is not stating a preferred time zone, whereas the conforming "+00:00" or any non-zero offset connotes that the offset being used is preferred. This convention regarding "-00:00" is derived from earlier RFCs, such as RFC 2822 which uses it for timestamps in email headers. RFC 2822 made no claim that any part of its timestamp format conforms to ISO 8601, and so was free to use this convention without conflict.
