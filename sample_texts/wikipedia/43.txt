Avery Stone of Noisey described Eilish's soprano vocals as "ethereal", and Maura Johnston of Rolling Stone characterized them as "whispery". Doreen St. FÃ©lix of The New Yorker opined that she has a "husky, slurring voice that she can thin out to reedy". Her music incorporates alternative pop, alternative rock, dark pop, EDM, electropop, indie pop, pop and trap. Eilish and her brother Finneas O'Connell collaborate on songwriting. Eilish called Finneas her partner in making music and said he produces her music and also performs with her on live shows. Eilish and Finneas "like to completely make up things and become characters" and "have songs that are really fictional". Eilish said a number of the songs also derive from her and Finneas' experiences. They try to write "really interesting and conversational" lyrics: "We try to say stuff that doesn't have to be that deep has made her brand so perfect for her whole career and she shouldn't have to hear that." She has named Rihanna as an inspiration for her style choices, after she called fashion her "defense mechanism" during an acceptance speech.. Much of the media attention surrounding Eilish has revolved around her fashion style, which consists primarily of baggy, ill-fitting clothing. In 2017, Eilish stated that she likes dressing out of her comfort zone to feel like she grabs the attention of everyone around her. Eilish states that she tries to be "really different from a lot of people", and wears clothing opposite to what others are wearing. Aiming to "look memorable", Eilish said she believes she "proved to people that I'm more important than they think", and she is "kind of intimidating, so people will listen up." In 2019, Eilish appeared in a Calvin Klein ad, wherein she mentioned that she dresses in baggy clothes in order to prevent people from body shaming her, stating: "Nobody can be like, 'She's slim-thick,' 'she's not slim-thick,' 'she's got a flat ass,' 'she's got a fat ass.' Nobody can say any of that because they don't know.". In April 2019, Eilish released clothing in collaboration with Takashi Murakami, inspired by her music video for "You Should See Me in a Crown", also directed and animated by Murakami, as well as a limited edition vinyl figure of herself from the video. Eilish also collaborated with Adobe Creative Cloud the same month for a series of advertisements as well as a social media art contest, where users would submit artwork with the hashtag "#BILLIExADOBE". Eilish appeared in the debut of Calvin Klein's "I Speak My Truth In #MyCalvins" ad campaign in May 2019, as well as the Ad Council's "Seize the Awkward" campaign, a series of PSAs targeting mental health awareness. She fronted MCM Worldwide's fall 2019 advertising campaign in July 2019, and later that month, collaborated with Los Angeles-based clothing brand Freak City for a clothing line. Also in July 2019, she performed at a dinner hosted by Chanel on Shelter Island to celebrate the brand's pop-up yacht club. In August 2019, Billie Eilish partnered with Apple to allow Apple Store customers to experiment with her song "You Should See Me in a Crown" in Music Lab sessions in its stores. Eilish's collaboration with the clothing company Siberia Hills was met with controversy after it was revealed that the company had used plagiarized designs of fan art of the character from Love Live!, drawn by artist Makoto Kurokawa, for Eilish's clothing line. The brand later clarified that Eilish herself had no knowledge of the plagiarism.. Eilish has stated that she has Tourette syndrome and synesthesia and has experienced depression. She was raised vegetarian and regularly advocates for veganism on social media.. * When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? . ;Headlining Where's My Mind Tour
