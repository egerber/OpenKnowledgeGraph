Library Genesis is a search engine for articles and books on various topics, which allows free access to content that is otherwise paywalled or not digitized elsewhere. Among others, it carries PDFs of content from Elsevier's ScienceDirect web-portal. Controversy surrounds the copyright status of many works accessible through this website. Some publishers like Elsevier have accused Library Genesis of providing pirate access to articles and books; in turn, said publishers have been accused of immorally benefiting from publicly tax funded works, research papers and textbooks written by professors on public payrolls.. Started around 2008 by Russian scientists, it absorbed the contents of, and became the functional successor to, library.nu, which was shut down by legal action in 2012. The portal primarily draws from the online database Sci-Hub, which was developed by scientific researcher and hacker Aleksandra Elbakyan, who was then a Kazakh graduate student. In 2011, this repository has archived more than 60 million articles.. In 2015, the website became involved in a legal case when Elsevier accused it of providing pirate access to articles and books. In response, the admins accused Elsevier of gaining most of its profits from publicly funded research which should be freely available as they are paid for by taxpayers. LibGen is reported to be registered in both Russia and Amsterdam, making it unclear which legislation applies, and whether defendants would attend a United States court hearing. LibGen is blocked by a number of ISPs in the United Kingdom, but such DNS-based blocks are claimed to do little to deter access. It is also blocked by ISPs in France, Germany, and Russia. In late October 2015, the District Court for the Southern District of New York ordered LibGen to shut down and to suspend use of the domain name , but the site is accessible through alternate domains.
