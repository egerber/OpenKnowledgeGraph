Intended to serve as a backup in his rookie season, he became the team's starting quarterback following starter Joe Flacco’s injury in a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He earned recognition during the year for his on-field success, which included helping the team clinch the AFC North division title and becoming the youngest starting quarterback in NFL playoff history.. Jackson was born to Felicia Jones and Lamar Jackson, Sr., on January 7, 1997 and grew up in the center of an economically distressed section of Pompano Beach, Florida.

He attended public schools and played Pop Warner football in the same Florida league with Ravens wide receiver Marquise Brown, though they were on different teams, with Jackson playing for the Pompano Beach Cowboys. Jackson's cousin Oakland Raiders cornerback Trayvon Mullen and Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Calvin Ridley also competed against Jackson in that league. At age 8, Jackson could throw a football 20 yards according to his first quarterback coach, Van "Peanut" Wilson and while he was in high school a home-made video shows him throwing a football 100 yards.. Jackson first attended Santaluces Community High School where he played football sporadically and sat out his sophomore year. He then transferred to Boynton Beach High School in Boynton Beach, Florida. At Boyton Beach Jackson played two seasons of varsity football. Boynton Beach coach Rick Swain remembered Jackson as a hard worker who continually improved his passing accuracy and decision-making and who watched hours of film each week. In his two years at Boyton Beach, Jackson threw 31 passing touchdowns, ran for 22 touchdowns, had over 2,000 passing yards, and a high school career accumulated quarterback rating of 102.7.

Jackson's career college statistics were as follows:. On January 5, 2018, Jackson officially announced that he would be entering the 2018 NFL Draft. Some draft pundits doubted Jackson's quarterback abilities and suggested that he switch positions due to his athleticism, but he remained adamant about his intention to play quarterback professionally. He declined to run drills such as the 40-yard dash during the NFL Scouting Combine, in order to focus on displaying his passing skills. Jackson was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round with the 32nd overall pick in the draft; they traded up for the selection with the Philadelphia Eagles. He was the fifth quarterback selected that year. Jackson made his NFL debut relieving starting quarterback Joe Flacco in the second half of a 47–3 victory against the Buffalo Bills, finishing with 24 passing yards and 39 rushing yards. During Week 7, Jackson scored his first NFL touchdown on a 1-yard run as the Ravens narrowly lost to the New Orleans Saints by a score of 24–23.

On November 18, 2018, Jackson made his first NFL start against the Cincinnati Bengals in place of the injured Joe Flacco, who injured his hip two weeks prior against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Overall, he finished with 1,201 passing yards, six passing touchdowns, and three interceptions. In addition, he led all quarterbacks with 695 rushing yards and added five rushing touchdowns. Jackson became the youngest quarterback to ever start a playoff game when the Ravens faced off at home against the Chargers in a rematch during the of the playoffs. Despite being held to just 25 passing yards at one point in the fourth quarter by a stout Chargers defense, Jackson then passed for two touchdowns in four minutes to bring the Ravens back from a 20-point deficit to within a touchdown. After forcing the Chargers to punt with less than a minute left, the Ravens had one last chance to win the game down six points, but Jackson was strip-sacked by Chargers linebacker Uchenna Nwosu. With the Chargers recovering the ball, the Ravens lost 23–17 and were knocked out of the playoffs. He finished the game completing 14 of 29 passes for 194 yards, the two aforementioned touchdowns, and an interception while rushing for 54 yards, losing one fumble. Once the 2018 season was over, the Ravens's coaching staff decided to abandon the offensive strategy that had been designed for Joe Flacco and create a new offensive philosophy centered around the specific skills of Jackson. That philosophy included changing every play in the playbook, the terminology used and drafting players or acquiring free agents that would complement Jackson's skills. In the season-opener against the Miami Dolphins, Jackson went 17 of 20 for career-high 324 yards and five touchdowns, making him the youngest quarterback to achieve a perfect passer rating in the 59–10 road victory. He was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week due to his spectacular performance. During Week 2 against the Arizona Cardinals, Jackson rushed for 120 yards and threw for 272 yards and two touchdowns, as the Ravens won by a score of 23–17.

For his performance, Jackson earned his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week award. Through eight games, Jackson's 637 rushing yards led Michael Vick's 2006 record of 573 for most by a quarterback, and his 95.4 passer rating was also the highest by a Ravens quarterback at midseason. In the next game, the Ravens routed the Bengals 49–13 with Jackson throwing for 223 yards and three touchdowns and rushing for 65 yards and a touchdown, finishing with a perfect passer rating. He became only the second player in NFL history to produce two perfect passer ratings in the same season. Jackson joined Aaron Rodgers .
