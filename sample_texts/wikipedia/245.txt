Reviewing for Variety, Caroline Framke thought the series does not always succeed in humanizing the royal family, but when it does, it is "as compelling a portrait of how power warps individuals, and the world along with them, as exists on TV." Ed Power from The Independent was less complimentary, praising Colman's performance but finding the series somewhat "colourless".
